        <h1>General Video Recording Tips</h1>
        <ul>
                <li> If there is both a video and situational assessment, use a device with a keyboard to complete written tasks more easily. </li>
                <li> Always wear formal clothes unless explicitly told otherwise. </li>
				<li> Wear respectable trousers/skirts etc in case the recording device is accidentally moved or repositioned. </li>
                <li> Make sure the room is well-lit so that the assessor can see your eyes clearly. </li>
                <li> Avoid distracting objects in the background such as posters. Use a clear background such as an empty wall instead. </li>
				<li> Avoid distracting noises in the background such as phone notifications. </li>
				<li> Place pets such as cats and dogs in a room different to the room where the recording is to take place. </li>
                <li> Ensure that the recording device is fixed on a flat surface so that it cannot move during the assessment. </li>
                <li> Charge any devices before you begin the assessment. </li>
                <li> Practice recording videos on the device to be used during the assessment before you begin the assessment. </li>
                <li> Become familiar with the recording software and its settings before the assessment. </li>
                <li> Look directly into the webcam when speaking. </li>
                <li> If glasses are worn, then limit glare from the device display by reducing its brightness setting. Ensure that the glasses are clean. </li>
                <li> Avoid looking into the webcam from unusual angles. The entire face should be visible and fill a good portion of the frame. </li>
                <li> Avoid talking too quickly or too slowly. Take pauses where necessary. </li>
        </ul>
