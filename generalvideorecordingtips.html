        <h1>General Video Recording Tips</h1>
        <ul>
                <li> If there is both a video and situational assessment, use a device with a keyboard to complete written tasks more easily.</li>
                <li> Always wear formal clothes unless explicitly told otherwise. </li>
                <li> Make sure the room is well-lit so that the assessor can see your eyes clearly.</li>
                <li> Avoid distracting objects in the background such as posters. Use a clear background such as an empty wall instead. </li>
                <li> Ensure that the recording device is fixed on a flat surface so that it cannot move during the assessment. </li>
                <li> Charge any devices before you begin the assessment. </li>
                <li> Practice recording videos on the device to be used during the assessment before you begin the assessment. </li>
                <li> Familiarise yourself with the recording software and its settings. </li>
                <li> Look directly into the webcam when recording your answer. </li>
                <li> If glasses are worn, then limit glare from the device display by reducing its brightness setting. Ensure that the glasses are clean. </li>
                <li> Avoid looking into the webcam from unusual angles. Make sure that your entire face is visible and fills a good portion of the frame. </li>
                <li> Avoid talking too quickly or too slowly. Take pauses where necessary. If possible, get feedback from another individual. </li>
        </ul>
