  <h1>General Video Recording Tips</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>If there is both a video and situational assessment, use a device with a keyboard to complete written tasks more easily.</li>
    <li>Always wear formal clothes unless explicitly told otherwise.</li>
    <li>Wear respectable trousers/skirts etc in case the recording device is accidentally moved or repositioned.</li>
    <li>Make sure the room is well-lit so that the assessor can see your eyes clearly.</li>
    <li>Avoid distracting objects in the background such as posters. Use a clear background such as an empty wall instead.</li>
    <li>Avoid distracting noises in the background such as phone notifications.</li>
    <li>Place pets such as cats and dogs in a room different to the room where the recording is to take place.</li>
    <li>Ensure that the recording device is fixed on a flat surface so that it cannot move during the assessment.</li>
    <li>Charge any devices before you begin the assessment.</li>
    <li>Practice recording videos on the device to be used during the assessment before you begin the assessment.</li>
    <li>Become familiar with the recording software and its settings before the assessment.</li>
    <li>Look directly into the webcam when speaking.</li>
    <li>If glasses are worn, then limit glare from the device display by reducing its brightness setting. Ensure that the glasses are clean.</li>
    <li>Avoid looking into the webcam from unusual angles. The entire face should be visible and fill a good portion of the frame.</li>
    <li>Avoid talking too quickly or too slowly. Take pauses where necessary.</li>
  </ul>
