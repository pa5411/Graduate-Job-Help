  <h1>Mental Health</h1>
  <p>Job hunting can be a difficult period for anyone and graduates are no exception. It is not uncommon to go through a range of unusually strong emotions which may include anger, frustration, loneliness and sadness. These emotions can also lead to issues which include anxiety, stress, depression and a loss of confidence. Other symptoms and issues not listed here may also arise. Should problems occur, it is important to recognise that there is a wide range of advice and self-help guides available from the NHS. Mental health services such as counselling and CBT are also available via the NHS but may have a waiting period. These services can be accessed by a referral from the GP. More recently some may be available to book directly from the NHS website. There are also various charities which also offer varying degrees of additional support.</p>

  <h2>Support from University</h2>
  <p>The majority of universities will have their own dedicated mental health support services which may also include counselling. Information on these services can be found on the university website. These services are usually accessible to existing students including undergraduate, postgraduate and PhD students. It is also possible to apply for an interruption of studies which is an official break from study. This can provide a student with a period of time where issues can be better managed and/or overcome, before recommencing studies at a later agreed upon date. They are typically arranged by discussing issues privately with one of either a form tutor, supervisor, year or group tutors or counsellor working at the university.</p>

  <p>Existing students and recent graduates will usually have access to a dedicated careers service. Aside from posting job adverts, there are usually also opportunities to speak to career advisors. These individuals can provide impartial tailored advice which may include suggesting resources for mental health support.</p>
