		<h1> Mental Health </h1>
		
		<p> Job hunting can be an a difficult period for anyone and graduates are no exception. It is not uncommon to go through a range of unusually strong emotions which include anger, frustration, loneliness and sadness. These emotions can also lead to issues which include anxiety, stress, depression and a loss of confidence. General support can be found from the NHS website, with links to self-help guides and accessing support channels such as counselling, CBT and group talking therapies. </p>
