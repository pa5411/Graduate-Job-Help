      <h1>Researching Companies and Topics</h1>
      <p>Throughout the application process, it will be expected that the applicant has good knowledge of the company, its values and the job description. For presentation tasks, a topic related to the company or its wider industry may also need to be researched. During the research, a number of questions should be kept in mind:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>What are the plans for the company in 1, 5 and 10 years time?</li>
        <li>What are the major upcoming innovations which can change the company or industry?</li>
        <li>What challenges does the company face?</li>	
      </ul>

      <p>The website of a company should always be the first place to use to gain a better understanding about its core business. Websites for large sized companies usually have pages named something along the lines of "careers", "about us", "case studies" and "news".</p>

      <p>The "careers" section will have a wide variety of information. This may include general information about the business of the company, specific information on roles held by its employees and guidance on the application process. The "about us" section will have detailed information on the business of the company and its values. There may also be links to business reports as well as statements on its ethics and sustainability policy. The reports may be detailed financial reports for each quarter or summary reports. Detailed financial reports may be difficult to consume. However summary reports are concise and would be useful to read at least in part. The "case studies" and "news" sections will provide information on recent projects with which the company has been involved.</p>

      <p>Aside from its website, a company will likely have social media which may include Twitter, YouTube and LinkedIn. The company may have multiple Twitter handles serving different purposes and regions, containing links to promotional content and recent projects. There may also exist dedicated twitter handles specifically for discussing career opportunities. Such handles provide links to new job adverts as well as providing advice for new and ongoing applicants.</p>

      <p>Existing company employees may also regularly give talks at university careers events as well as conferences. These talks are often published on YouTube either by one of its channels or by another channel not affiliated with the company. Many talks are usually between 30 to 60 minutes in length. A useful trick to locate some of these talks quickly is to therefore filter YouTube search results to show only content which is greater than 20 minutes. The talks often contain invaluable advice which may be difficult to locate in one place from other sources. Existing employees of the company may also be found on LinkedIn. They may "like" or post new content on LinkedIn which may be useful to read. Additionally, existing employees may be contacted for further insight, although a reply should not be expected nor demanded.</p>

      <p>Other sources of information include websites which cover the particular industry, such as news sites, blogs and forums. Search providers using appropriate search operators, as described in <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433">Google's documentation for search operators</a>, may be useful in this regard. Depending on the experience and topic, it may also be useful to use browse through academic papers. Smaller sized companies typically have less promotional material available then larger sized companies. Industry relevant websites and LinkedIn become particularly useful in such cases.</P>

      <h2>General Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure that the core business of the company is well understood.</li>
        <li>Demonstrate understanding of the values of the company during all parts of the application process.</li> 
        <li>Avoid reading only career dedicated resources. Use other sources as well such as reports and external industry websites.</li>
        <li>Applicants should read through a handful of projects or case studies of interest to use as examples during the application process.</li>
        <li>Make written or typed notes during the research process so that information can be found easily at a later date.</li>
        <li>Keep up to date with industry news on a regular basis, irrespective of whether an application is being made. </li>
      </ul>
