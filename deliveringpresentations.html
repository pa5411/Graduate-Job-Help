        <h1> Delivering Presentations </h1>
		
        <p> Sometimes a company will request for the applicant to present on a topic. The applicant will therefore be required to talk about a topic for a certain period of time. The amount of time varies but is typically between 5 to 15 minutes. Both the time allocated and the nature of the topic will usually be provided a few days or weeks before the date the presentation is due to be given. It may or may not be necessary to create accompanying slides. </p>
		
		<h2> How to prepare the presentation </h2>
		
		<p> The presentation should have a clear line of thought such as: An introduction, the problem considered, the method, the key points or results, a discussion and a summary. Information about how to obtain the relevant information for the presentation may be found <a href="/researchingcompaniesandtopics.html">here</a>. Be able to remember the sources used in case their information is questioned. </p> 
		
		<h3> Introduction </h3>
		
		<p> There should always be an introductory section which outlines the purpose of the presentation. There should then be a brief overview of the contents of the remaining talk as well as what the audience can expect to gain from the remaining parts. </p>
		
		<h3> Key Points </h3>
		
		<p>  </p>
		
		<h3> Discussion </h3>
		
		<p> The discussion may be integrated with the key points or be a separate dedicated section of the presentation. This is an opportunity to showcase opinion and new ideas. Justify opinions with the key points or with evidence from other sources. Consider the implication of any results or key points, particularly with regards to how they may influence the company as well as the wider industry. </p>
	
		<h3> Summary </h3>
	
		<h2> How to prepare software slides </h2>
		
		<p> The slide should progress linearly throughout. You should not need to go back and fourth through slides unless the assessor has asked to view a previous slide or you are using a slide to answer a question. </p>
		
		<p> Typical software tools used to create slides are MS PowerPoint, Beamer (LaTeX) or Google Slides. </p>
		
		<ul>
		        <li> Usually you should have about one slide for every minute of the talk. <li>
				<li> Include a table of contents and a summary. </li>
				<li> Only use a few bullet points per slide. </li>
				<li> Avoid slides with a large amount of text. </li>
				<li> Avoid images that are too small or pixelated. </li>
				<li> Avoid using gifs or videos since there may be technical issues which prevent them from being displayed correctly. </li>
				<li> References may either be stated on the appropriate slide or listed as part of a complete bibliography on a dedicated slide at the end </li>.
				<li> Avoid using graphs with axes and labels that are unclear. Re-label them using text boxes on the slides instead. </li>
				<li> Use a simple business relevant template. If discussing previous university work, then use a templates from the university website. </li>
				<li> Retain a backup of the slides that can be used in case the primary location of the slides is inaccessible. </li> 
				<li> It may be useful to indicate page numbers and section headings on each slide of the presentation. </li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2> How to deliver the speech </h2>
		
		<p> The presentation may be delivered virtually (via video software) or in-person. General tips on using video software to interact with employers can be found <a href="https://pa5411.github.io/generalvideorecordingtips.html">here</a>. If slides have been created, in both cases remember to have a back-up device or location in case the primary location fails. </p>
		
		<h3> Before the speech </h3>
		
		<ul>
				<li> Write out the speech and memorise what is to be said. Use prompt cards with bullet points to summarise the speech. </li> 
				<li> Practise speaking and timing the speech several times. </li>		
		</ul>
		
		<h3> During the speech </h3>
		
		<p> Try to remain calm and composed during the presentation. One common mistake is to begin talking too quickly, which can be avoided by taking pauses where necessary. Have a drink of water on hand since talking for prolonged periods can lead to a dry mouth. It can be nerve-wracking to deliver a presentation, particularly to industry professionals. It may therefore be useful to try to think of the presentation as a chat between two or more parties who share a common interest.  </p>
		
		<ul>
		        <li> Speak clearly and take pauses when needed. </li> 
				<li> Avoid profanity. </li>  
				<li> Look at the audience whilst speaking. </li> 
				<li> If desired, involve the audience by posing them questions. </li> 
                <li> Avoiding reading word for word from a script. Use prompt cards with bullet point summaries instead. </li>
				<li> Have a watch to assist with timing during the presentation since a clock or mobile phone may not be available. </li> 
				<li> Do not be afraid to take a slightly longer pauses to recompose and/or give the audience a moment to reflect. </li>		
				<li> If applicable, refer to and explain information on slides regularly. </li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3> After the speech </h3>
		
		<p> There will usually be a short period of time for the assessors to ask either pre-determined questions and/or specific questions based on the content of the presentation. It is useful to prepare additional content which is only revealed to the assessors if it helps to answer any relevant questions which may come up. Examples of additional content may include additional results or graphs as well as discussion points on related topics, companies or industries. If a question cannot be answered it is better instead to make an educated guess and defer a complete answer for later. It may then be useful to provide a brief overview of the steps to be taken to obtain the answer as well as provide an approximate time frame for how long this will take. </p>
		
		<p> The company may or may not provide feedback. Usually feedback is provided if the presentation forms part of an interview and/or assessment centre. The feedback may be generalised, providing an overall summary of how well an applicant performed across the different assessments. Alternatively, there may be specific and separate feedback for each assessment performed. </p>
