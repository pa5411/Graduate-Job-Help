      <h1>Delivering Presentations</h1>
      <p>Sometimes a company will request for an applicant to present on a topic. The topic is often based on either previous work or something related to the company and the wider industry. The applicant will be required to talk about a topic for a certain period of time. The amount of time varies but is typically between 5 to 15 minutes. Both the time allocated and the nature of the topic will usually be provided a few days or weeks before the date the presentation is due to be given. It may or may not be necessary to create accompanying slides.</p>

      <h2>How to prepare the presentation</h2>
      <p>The presentation should have a clear line of thought such as: An introduction, the problem considered, the method, the key points (or results), a discussion and a summary. Information about how to obtain the relevant information where the topic is not based on previous work may be found in the <a href="/uk-graduate-job-advice/researchingcompaniesandtopics.html">researching a company guide</a>.</p>

      <h3>Introduction & The Problem Considered</h3>
      <p>There should always be an introductory section which outlines the purpose of the presentation. Ensure to restate the question asked by an assessor, to provide context of what is to follow later in the presentation. More complex questions may be reduced to smaller pieces if necessary. There should then be a brief overview of the contents of the remaining presentation as well as what the audience can expect to gain from its remaining parts.</p>

      <h3>Method</h3>
      <p>The inclusion of this section and its length depends on the type of presentation given. A presentation which discusses previous research should outline its methodology. However avoid too much detail on techniques which the employer may not fully understand nor be interested in. Similarly for presentations where the employer has given a specific topic to discuss, a similar balance is needed. In some cases for example, it may be useful to list sources of information considered or excluded, such as "Business Report 2019", as well as the reasons for making these decisions. However, it may be equally valid to omit a method section in this case, particularly for very short presentations.</p>

      <h3>Key Points</h3>
      <p>This section describes key results which may or may not be integrated with the discussion. The results should address each part of the problem raised earlier. A balance needs to be made between presenting summarised information within the short time frame afforded to the presentation but with sufficient detail to make each point well. Note that the majority of the presentation should be focused on this section as well as the discussion section. If there are too many points to be made within the allocated time, consider outlining the most important points in detail and only briefly mentioning the other points if at all. Instead, the other points may be used to create additional material (see later) to be brought up later if needed at the end of the presentation.</p>

      <h3>Discussion</h3>
      <p>The discussion may be integrated with the key points or be a separate dedicated section of the presentation. This is an opportunity to showcase opinion and new ideas. Justify opinions with the key points or with evidence from other sources. Consider the implication of any results or key points, particularly with regards to how they may influence the company as well as the wider industry.</p>

      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>Every presentation must end with a summary which gives an overview of the major points discussed. It is useful here to first restate briefly the purpose of the presentation as well as the problem considered, before summarising the key points. Always end the summary thanking the audience for giving their time to listen to the presentation and then opening the floor to questions that they may have.</p>

      <h3>Additional Material</h3>
      <p>It is useful to prepare additional material which is only shown to the assessors if it helps to answer any relevant questions which may come up both during and after the presentation. Examples of additional material may include extra results or graphs as well as discussion points on related topics such as companies or industries which do not quite fit into the main presentation.</p>

      <h2>How to prepare software slides</h2>
      <p>Typical software tools used to create slides are MS PowerPoint, Beamer (LaTeX) or Google Slides. The slides should progress linearly throughout. In other words, it should not necessary to go back and fourth through slides unless the assessor has asked to view a previous slide or a slide is used to answer a question during the presentation. Retain a backup of the slides that can be used in case the primary location of the slides is inaccessible. The general format of the slides should be as follows:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Use a simple business relevant template. If discussing previous university work, then use a template from the university website.</li>
        <li>A general rule of thumb is that there should be about one slide for every minute of the talk.</li>
        <li>Include a table of contents and a summary.</li>
        <li>Only use a few bullet points per slide.</li>
        <li>Avoid slides with a large amount of text.</li>
        <li>Avoid images that are too small or pixelated.</li>
        <li>Avoid using .gifs or videos since there may be technical issues which prevent them from being displayed correctly.</li>
        <li>Avoid using graphs with axes and labels that are unclear. Re-label them using text boxes on the slides instead.</li>
        <li>It may be useful to indicate page numbers and section headings on each slide of the presentation.</li>
        <li>References may either be stated on the appropriate slide or listed as part of a complete bibliography on a dedicated slide at the end.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to deliver the speech</h2>
      <p>The presentation may be delivered virtually (via video software) or in-person. General tips on using video software to interact with employers can be found in the <a href="/uk-graduate-job-advice/generalvideorecordingtips.html">video recording tips guide</a>. If slides have been created, in both cases remember to have a back-up device or location in case the primary location fails.</p>

      <h3>Before the speech</h3>
      <p>The speech should be practised as many times as necessary for it to be memorised. If needed, write prompt cards with bullet points to summarise the speech, to assist with its delivery later. Try and get another individual who can both listen to the presentation and provide comments and feedback about its content and delivery. Alternatively, use video to record delivering the presentation for analysis later.</p>

      <h3>During the speech</h3>
      <p>Try to remain calm and composed during the presentation. One common mistake is to begin talking too quickly, which can be avoided by taking pauses where necessary. Have a drink of water on hand since talking for prolonged periods can lead to a dry mouth. It can be nerve-wracking to deliver a presentation, particularly to industry professionals. It may therefore be useful to try to think of the presentation as a chat between two or more parties who share a common interest.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Speak clearly and take pauses when needed.</li>
        <li>Avoid profanity.</li> 
        <li>Look at the audience whilst speaking.</li>
        <li>If desired, involve the audience by posing them questions.</li>
        <li>Avoiding reading word for word from a script. Use prompt cards with bullet point summaries instead.</li>
        <li>Have a watch to assist with timing during the presentation since a clock or mobile phone may not be available.</li>
        <li>Do not be afraid to take a slightly longer pauses to recompose and/or give the audience a moment to reflect.</li>		
        <li>If applicable, refer to and explain information on slides regularly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>After the speech</h3>
      <p>There will usually be a short period of time for the assessors to ask either pre-determined questions and/or specific questions based on the content of the presentation. Use any prepared additional material here if relevant. If a question cannot be answered it is better instead to make an educated guess and defer a complete answer for later. It may then be useful to provide a brief overview of the steps to be taken to obtain the answer as well as provide an approximate time frame for how long this will take.</p>

      <p>The company may or may not provide feedback. Usually feedback is provided if the presentation forms part of an interview and/or assessment centre. The feedback may be generalised, providing an overall summary of how well an applicant performed across the different assessments. Alternatively, there may be specific and separate feedback for each assessment performed.</p>
