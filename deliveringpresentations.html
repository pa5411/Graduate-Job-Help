        <h1> Delivering Presentations </h1>
		
        <p> Sometimes a company will request for the applicant to present on a topic. The applicant will therefore be required to talk about a topic for a certain period of time. The amount of time varies but is typically between 5 to 15 minutes. Both the time allocated and the nature of the topic will usually be provided a few days or weeks before the date the presentation is due to be given. It may or may not be necessary to create accompanying slides. </p>
		
		<h2> How to prepare the presentation </h2>
		
		<p> The presentation should have a clear line of thought such as: An introduction, the problem considered, the method, the key points or results, a discussion and a summary. Information about how to obtain the relevant information for the presentation may be found <a href="/researchingcompaniesandtopics.html">here</a>. Be able to remember the sources used in case their information is questioned. </p> 
		
		<h3> Introduction </h3>
		
		<p> There should always be an introductory section which outlines the purpose of the presentation. There should then be a brief overview of the contents of the remaining talk as well as what the audience can expect to gain from the remaining parts. </p>
		
		<h3> Key Points </h3>

		<h3> Discussion </h3>
		
		<p> The discussion may be integrated with the key points or be a separate dedicated section of the presentation. </p>
	
		<h3> Summary </h3>
	
		<h2> How to prepare software slides </h2>
		
		<p> The slide should progress linearly throughout. You should not need to go back and fourth through slides unless the assessor has asked to view a previous slide or you are using a slide to answer a question. </p>
		
		<p> Typical software tools used to create slides are MS PowerPoint, Beamer (LaTeX) or Google Slides. </p>
		
		<ul>
		        <li> Usually you should have about one slide for every minute of the talk. <li>
				<li> Include a table of contents and a summary. </li>
				<li> Only use a few bullet points per slide. </li>
				<li> Avoid slides with a large amount of text. </li>
				<li> Avoid images that are too small or pixelated. </li>
				<li> Avoid using gifs or videos since there may be technical issues which prevent them from being displayed correctly. </li>
				<li> References may either be stated on the appropriate slide or listed as part of a complete bibliography on a dedicated slide at the end </li>.
				<li> Avoid using graphs with axes and labels that are unclear. Re-label them using text boxes on the slides instead. </li>
				<li> Use a simple business relevant template. If discussing previous university work, then use a templates from the university website. </li>
				<li> Retain a backup of the slides that can be used in case the primary location of the slides is inaccessible. </li> 
				<li> It may be useful to indicate page numbers and section headings on each slide of the presentation. </li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2> How to deliver the speech </h2>
		
		<h3> Before the speech </h3>
		
		<ul>
				<li> Write out the speech and memorise what is to be said. Use prompt cards with bullet points to summarise the speech. </li> 
				<li> Practise speaking and timing the speech several times. </li>		
		</ul>
		
		<h3> During the speech </h3>
		
		<ul>
		        <li> Speak clearly and take pauses regularly. </li> 
				<li> Avoid profanity. </li>  
				<li> Look at the audience whilst speaking. </li> 
				<li> If desired, involve the audience by posing them questions. </li> 
                <li> Avoiding reading word for word from a script. Use prompt cards with bullet point summaries instead. </li>
				<li> Have a watch to assist with timing during the presentation since a clock or mobile phone may not be available. </li> 
				<li> Do not be afraid to take a slightly longer pauses to recompose and/or give the audience a moment to reflect. </li>		
				<li> If applicable, refer to and explain information on slides regularly. </li>
		</ul>
