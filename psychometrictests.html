        <h1>Psychometric Tests</h1>
		<p> An applicant will usually encounter four types of psychometric tests which are situational, logical reasoning, numerical reasoning and verbal reasoning. A fifth test, game assessments, may also be encountered, which either incorporates aspects of the other four types or is a separate test in itself. </p>
		
		<h3> Situational Tests </h3>
		
		<p> These tests are designed to gain insight into how an applicant will react to common situations which are encountered whilst working at the company. In the majority of these tests, a passage of text will be provided which outlines a situation (or problem). The applicant will then be required to rank a number of possible responses to the problem. Usually there are about 5 responses to rank. The ranking may be based on "most preferred way of working" to "least preferred way of working". Alternatively the ranking may be based on "best response", "good response", "average", "poor response" and "worst response". Some examples of typical question and the responses which require ranking are as follows: </p>
		
		<p> Question 1: You are told that there is a senior manager who has overall responsibility for this project. What is your ideal way of working with them? Rank the options below, with 1 being your most preferred way of working and 5 being your least preferred way of working. Options: </p>  
		
		<ul>
		        <li> [A] You show openness to collaborate with the manager on the project. You make a note to contact them once you have ideas to share. </li> 
		        <li> [B] You reach out to the manager to arrange an online meeting. Collaborating early is beneficial to the project. </li>
				<li> [C] You tackle issues on your own before contacting the manager. This way you are prepared when you meet, which helps your credibility. </li>
                <li> [D] You wait for the manager to contact you as they know that you have joined the team. You remain happy to collaborate or lead the project. </li>
                <li> [E] You research the project, emailing the manager later with your findings. This ensures you do not fall behind in project work. </li>
        </ul>				
		
		<p> For this question, one answer may be 1-[B], 2-[A], 3-[C], 4-[E] and 5-[D], which means that B was the most preferred response to the problem, followed by A, then C etc. D was the least preferred response to the problem. The least preferred option does not necessarily mean that it is a bad option. Rather, it only means that it is the least preferred option out of the options which were given. </p> 
		
		<p> Question 2: Mark has noted that his colleague, Claire, is late to work on Wednesdays and Thursdays. On Wednesday Claire arrives 30 minutes late to again. Mark asks her if everything is okay. Claire says it has got nothing to with him. For each option, state whether it is a 1-"great response", 2-"good response", 3-"neither bad or good response", 4-"poor response" and 5-"terrible response". </p> 
		
		<ul>
		        <li> [A] Apologise to Claire for asking a question about her personal life. </li> 
		        <li> [B] Explain to Claire that you are concerned about her. </li>
				<li> [C] Restate to Claire that you are there if she needs someone to talk to about anything. </li>
                <li> [D] Ask Claire if she has spoken to her manager about her problems. </li>
                <li> [E] Tell Claire that you cannot understand why she will not share with you her problem. </li>
        </ul>	

        <p> Question 2 differs from question 1 in that each option needs to be ranked (or rated) individually. One answer may be [A]-1, [B]-3, [C]-2, [D]-3 and [E]-5. Note here that in this answer, two responses were considered a "great response" and "poor response" was not used. In general, the question should make it clear whether multiple response types are allowed. </p> 
		
		<h4> Tips for situational tests: </h4>
		
		<p> There are sometimes answers to questions which should be obvious. For example, question 2 part [E] is a bad response because a colleague should be forced to have to explain a personal matter to another colleague. However, there are often times when the answers are less clear. It is therefore important to always keep in mind both the values of the company and the skills listed within the job description. If for example, there is a focus on teamwork, then it may be wise to use answers where there is a preference to working more within the team rather than independently. </p> 
		
		<p> Situational tests can be very difficult because there exists no "blanket rule" that can be applied for every company and role. In other words, an answer which may be correct for one role at a company may be incorrect for the same role at another company. Equally, the same company may expect different responses based on the different roles which it advertises. </p> 
		
		<p> Applicants must also simultaneously find a balance between answering the questions honestly but also acknowledging the type of employee which the company seeks. It is advised not to outright lie since the role may not otherwise be suitable and this may lead to significant job dissatisfaction. However, do not be afraid of selecting options where the necessary skills are lacking. For example, options about managing a project may be selected where there is a desire to do so, even if little experience has been accumulated to date. </p>
		
		<p> Situational tests can vary in the length of time needed to complete them. There may also be several situational tests to complete as part of the application process. Many of the tests are untimed and it is therefore not uncommon for each test to take several hours to complete. Note as well the subtle difference between untimed and not recorded. A test may be untimed, but the time taken for the test to be completed may still be noted by the company. </p>
