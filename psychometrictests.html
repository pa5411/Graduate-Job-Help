      <h1>Psychometric Tests</h1>
      <p>Large companies will usually use a series of psychometric tests to help sift through candidates. The four most common types of psychometric tests encountered are situational (judgement), logical reasoning, numerical reasoning and verbal reasoning. A fifth test, called game assessments, either incorporates aspects of the other four types or is a separate test in itself. Each test measures a certain set of skills and will be covered in dedicated sections below.</p>

      <h2 id="general-advice">General Advice</h2>
      <p>A company will send correspondence, usually via email, with details on how to carry out the psychometric tests. A test may have to be carried out either via a browser or sometimes using an application on a mobile device. Some companies choose to create their own psychometric tests whereas others use tests designed by external companies. The most common (external) companies used by employers appear to be Arctic Shores, Cubiks, HireVue, Korn Ferry (TalentQ) and SHL. Usually a practice question will be given prior to starting any given test, however this may not always be the case. Practice questions or tests, as well as advice, may sometimes be found on the websites of either the company to which is being applied and/or the external company that designed the test.</p>

      <p>The tests will be graded and applicants "passed" using internal scoring systems which are typically not made available to the public. Each company will have its own scoring system. At an educated guess, the scoring may be based on some combination of the following criteria:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>One or more points available for each question.</li>
        <li>Higher number of points available for more difficult questions.</li>
        <li>A weighting based on number of correct answers given within a specified period of time. For example, 10 questions answered correctly in 5 minutes is awarded 10 points whereas 20 correct answers in the same time period is awarded 30 points.</li>
        <li>Negative marking, where points are deducted for an incorrect answer.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>What constitutes "passing" a test differs for each company. In the majority of cases, a threshold will need to be met or exceeded to progress to the next stage of the application process. For example, it may be necessary to achieve an overall grade of 75% (of the total available points) or higher to progress. However there may also be other requirements. Some companies may require scoring at least a certain grade in all the given tests. Alternatively other companies may only have a requirement to perform well in some of the tests, depending on the grades achieved.</p>

      <p>At some point during the application process, a company will likely use a second threshold which compares the scores of all applicants. They may compare the highest scoring applicants for each test. Alternatively they may gather the scores from each test and get a single overall weighted grade. In either case, only a certain portion of the top scoring applicants will progress to the next stage. This can lead to a situation where the test can be "passed" according to the first threshold but not "passed" according to the second threshold.</p>

      <p>An example of the scoring system may be as follows. Consider a situation where 1000 people apply for a job at Company A. They are all given one test and the first threshold to pass the test is 75%. 300 people meet this requirement, but Company A only has 200 positions available for the next stage of the application process. A second threshold is therefore used to only progress the first 200 people with the highest grades.</p>

      <p>Some of the tests may be timed and some may not. It is therefore important to read any correspondence carefully and understand what is expected for each test. If there is any doubt, it is better to email the company and ask before starting the test. Note the subtle difference between untimed and not recorded. A test may be untimed, but the time taken for the test to be completed may still be noted by the company.</p>

      <h3 id="general-tips">Additional tips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Find a quiet place where they will be no disturbances to do a test.</li>
        <li>Have a pen and paper ready to use for any calculations or notes.</li>
        <li>Avoid guessing if possible, where it is known that negative marking exists.</li>
        <li>Prepare beforehand by using practice material if possible.</li>
        <li>Avoid completing a test close to its deadline to avoid unexpected external factors (e.g. illness or internet connectivity issues).
        <li>Be fully awake, rested and calm before starting the test.</li>
        <li>Do not have someone else sit a test on your behalf. It is immoral and there may be a requirement to re-sit the test later during the application process.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="situational-tests">Situational Tests</h2>
      <p>These tests are designed to gain insight into how an applicant will react to common situations which are encountered whilst working at the company. In the majority of these tests, a passage of text will be provided which outlines a situation (or problem). The applicant will then be required to rank a number of possible responses to the problem. Usually there are about 5 responses to rank. The ranking may be based on "most preferred way of working" to "least preferred way of working". Alternatively the ranking may be based on "best response", "good response", "average", "poor response" and "worst response". </p>

      <h3 id="situational-tests-examples">Situational test examples:</h3>

      <p>Some examples of typical question and the responses which require ranking are as follows:</p>

      <p>Question 1: You are told that there is a senior manager who has overall responsibility for this project. What is your ideal way of working with them? Rank the options below, with 1 being your most preferred way of working and 5 being your least preferred way of working. Options:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>[A] You show openness to work with the manager on the project. You make a note to contact them once you have ideas to share.</li>
        <li>[B] You reach out to the manager to arrange an online meeting. Collaborating early is beneficial to the project.</li>
        <li>[C] You tackle issues on your own to be prepared before contacting the manager, improving your credibility when you meet.</li>
        <li>[D] You wait for the manager to contact you. They know that you have joined the team. You are happy to lead if required.</li>
        <li>[E] You research the project, emailing the manager later with your findings. This ensures you do not fall behind in project work.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For this question, one answer may be 1-[B], 2-[A], 3-[C], 4-[E] and 5-[D], which means that B was the most preferred response to the problem, followed by A, then C etc. D was the least preferred response to the problem. The least preferred option does not necessarily mean that it is a bad option. Rather, it only means that it is the least preferred option out of the options which were given.</p>

      <p>Question 2: Mark has noted that his colleague, Claire, is late to work on Wednesdays and Thursdays. On Wednesday Claire again arrives 30 minutes late. Mark asks her if everything is okay. Claire says it has got nothing to do with him. For each option, state whether it is a 1-"great response", 2-"good response", 3-"neither bad or good response", 4-"poor response" and 5-"terrible response".</p>

      <ul>
        <li>[A] Apologise to Claire for asking a question about her personal life.</li>
        <li>[B] Explain to Claire that you are concerned about her.</li>
        <li>[C] Restate to Claire that you are there if she needs someone to talk to about anything.</li>
        <li>[D] Ask Claire if she has spoken to her manager about her problems.</li>
        <li>[E] Tell Claire that you cannot understand why she will not share with you her problem.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>One answer here may be [A]-1, [B]-3, [C]-2, [D]-3 and [E]-5. Note here that in this answer, two responses were considered a "great response" and "poor response" was not used. In general, the question should make it clear whether multiple response types are allowed.</p>

      <p>There are sometimes answers to questions which should be obvious. For example, question 2 part [E] is a bad response because a colleague should not be forced to have to explain a personal matter to another colleague. However, there are often times when the answers are less clear. It is therefore important to always keep in mind both the values of the company and the skills listed within the job description. If for example, there is a focus on teamwork, then it may be wise to use answers where there is a preference to working more within the team rather than independently.</p>

      <h3 id="situational-tests-tips">Tips for situational tests:</h3>

      <p>Situational tests can be very difficult because there exists no "blanket rule" that can be applied for every company and role. In other words, an answer which may be correct for one role at a company may be incorrect for the same role at another company. Equally, the same company may expect different responses based on the different roles which it advertises.</p>

      <p>A balance must be found between answering the questions honestly but also simultaneously acknowledging the type of employee which the company seeks. It is advised not to outright lie since the role may not otherwise be suitable and this may lead to significant job dissatisfaction. However, do not be afraid of selecting options where the necessary skills are lacking. For example, options about managing a project may be selected where there is a desire to do so, even if little experience has been accumulated to date.</p>

      <p>Situational tests can vary in the length of time needed to complete them. There may also be several situational tests to complete as part of the application process. Many of the tests are untimed and it is therefore not uncommon for each test to take several hours to complete. </p>

      <h2 id="logical-reasoning-tests">Logical Reasoning Tests</h2>
      <p>These tests assess inductive reasoning, which is a measure of the ability to determine the most reasonable solution to a given problem. Usually each question in the test contains a sequence of patterns containing a missing term which must be identified. The patterns are often based around combinations of shapes, arrows or grid lines, each of which may vary in number, colour or position in a systematic way.</p>

      <h3 id="logical-reasoning-tests-examples">Logical reasoning test examples:</h3>

      <p>One example of a typical question is shown in <a href="#figurelogone">Figure 1</a>.</p>

      <figure>
        <img id="figurelogone" src="/uk-graduate-job-advice/assets/img/logreason1.png" alt="A typical logical reasoning based question." width="70%">
        <figcaption>Figure 1 - An example of a question faced during a logical reasoning test.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Figure 1 has different colours (black and white) and shapes (circles, squares and diamonds). To identify the next sequence in the pattern, a relationship must be identified which gives a reasonable explanation as to how the pattern progresses from one box to the next, left to right. One way this is accomplished is to label the different elements of the boxes as shown in <a href="#figurelogoneb">Figure 2</a>.</p>

      <figure>
        <img id="figurelogoneb" src="/uk-graduate-job-advice/assets/img/logreason1b.png" alt="Solving the logical reasoning question of Figure 1." width="30%">
        <figcaption>Figure 2 - A method to solve the logical reasoning question shown in <a href="#figurelogone">Figure 1</a>.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Box one in Figure 2 has three different shapes. Its largest sized shape is a square and is labelled "1". Its middle sized shape is a diamond and is labelled "2" whilst its smallest sized shape is a circle which is labelled "3". The shapes in box 2 and 3 can be labelled in a similar way. A pattern begins to emerge when the labels (shapes) between each box are examined more closely:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The shape for label 1 in box one becomes the shape for label 2 in box two. (1 to 2)</li>
        <li>The shape for label 2 in box one becomes the shape for label 3 in box two. (2 to 3)</li>
        <li>The shape for label 3 in box one becomes the shape for label 1 in box two. (3 to 1)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In other words, the labels that each shape had in box one changed systematically when box two was examined. This may be a pattern between box one and two, but it is important to check that the pattern occurs between subsequent boxes. This is shown below for changes between box two and three and is confirmed by inspection of the remaining boxes.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The shape for label 1 in box two becomes the shape for label 2 in box three. (1 to 2)</li>
        <li>The shape for label 2 in box two becomes the shape for label 3 in box three. (2 to 3)</li>
        <li>The shape for label 3 in box two becomes the shape for label 1 in box three. (3 to 1)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>From the logic above there can only be two solutions, A and B for the question shown in <a href="#figurelogone">Figure 1</a>. To determine which of the two is the best solution, notice that for every box, the colour of its smallest sized shape alternates between black and white. Since the smallest sized shape in box 1 is black, the smallest sized shape in box 2 is therefore white. Similarly, the smallest sized shape in box 3 is again black and so fourth. This means that the most reasonable solution for this question is A.</p>

      <p>The four logical patterns can be stated as follows:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The largest sized shape of the current box is the same as the smallest sized shape of the proceeding box.</li>
        <li>The middle sized shape of the current box is the same as the largest sized shape of the proceeding box.</li>
        <li>The smallest sized shape of the current box is the same as the middle sized shape of the proceeding box.</li>
        <li>If the smallest sized shape of the proceeding box is white, then the smallest sized shape of the current box is black and vice versa.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The deductions made here were based on the most reasonable patterns. It may be possible to find another pattern which works, but the key is to find the pattern which is most reasonable. This can usually be interpreted as meaning the "simplest" pattern. Notice that the changes were deduced by examining boxes directly next to each other, for example between box 1 and box 2. This may not always be the case. Sometimes the pattern may only be deduced by inspecting changes between every <i>other</i> box or more, for example between box 1 and box 3 or between box 1 and 4.</p>

      <p>It is important to note that even though some changes may occur, it may not necessarily form part of the overall pattern. This is more clearly seen with the use of another example question which is shown in <a href="#figurelogtwo">Figure 3</a>.</p>

      <figure>
        <img id="figurelogtwo" src="/uk-graduate-job-advice/assets/img/logreason2.png" alt="Another typical logical reasoning based question." width="70%">
        <figcaption>Figure 3 - Another example of a typical question faced during a logical reasoning test.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>In this question, rather than a linear sequence of boxes, there is now a grid of nine boxes with the middle box missing. At first glance, there are different shapes (circles and squares), different colours (black and white) and connections between the shapes, indicated by solid vertical or horizontal lines. To identify the pattern here, one approach is to divide the grid into rows and columns, as shown in <a href="#figurelogtwob">Figure 4</a>.</p>

      <figure>
        <img id="figurelogtwob" src="/uk-graduate-job-advice/assets/img/logreason2b.png" alt="Solving the logical reasoning question of Figure 3." width="50%">
        <figcaption>Figure 4 - A method to solve the logical reasoning question shown in <a href="#figurelogtwo">Figure 3</a>.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>The next step is to identify how row 1 may be related to row 3 or similarly column 1 is related to column 3. This question is more difficult than the previous question because whilst some changes occur, they do not form any obvious pattern. For example, the number of squares and circles may clearly change in each box but the changes overall do not appear to form a pattern. Similarly the number of connections in each box do not form an obvious pattern. In this situation, when the pattern is not immediately obvious, it is helpful to form a mental list of <i>possible</i> patterns. Then go through each item in the list one by one and remove anything which is not correct. For example:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><s>Number of circles and squares in each box for each row/column.</s></li>
        <li><s> Number of connections in each box for each row/column.</s></li>
        <li>Position of circles and squares in each box for each row/column.</li>
        <li>Colour of the circles and squares in each box for each row/column.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In the list, some parts have been removed because it has already been established that they do not lead to an obvious pattern. Hopefully at some point, a pattern will be identified from something in the list. In this case, this occurs for the last bullet point. In the question, observe that for row 1, the number of coloured objects for the box in column 1 is the same as the number of coloured objects for the box in column 3. This is shown in <a href="#figurelogtwoc">Figure 5</a>, with the relevant objects coloured in red for clarity. The box in column 2 has one more coloured object (three in total), which is depicted in cyan. Similarly observe that for row 3, the number of coloured objects in column 1 and 3 are the same and the middle column has one fewer coloured objects. This is shown in <a href="#figurelogtwod">Figure 6</a>.</p>

      <figure>
        <img id="figurelogtwoc" src="/uk-graduate-job-advice/assets/img/logreason2c.png" alt="Solving the logical reasoning question of Figure 3." width="50%">

        <figcaption>Figure 6 - A method to solve the logical reasoning question shown in <a href="#figurelogtwo">Figure 3</a>.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>In row 2, the boxes in columns 1 and 3 have three coloured objects and therefore the missing box in column 2 must not have three coloured objects. It is also reasonable to assume that it either has exactly one more or one less coloured object. This excludes options C and E. At this point there still remain 3 possible solutions, so it may be helpful to examine the solutions to gain some insight. Each solution contains connections between the shapes. Notice in the question that whenever there is a vertical connection to a shape, there is always a horizontal connection from the same shape. This therefore excludes options B and D. The solution is therefore A.</p>
