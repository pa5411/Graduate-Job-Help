      <h1>Cover Letter</h1>
      <p>The cover letter is a short document which complements a CV and demonstrates the reasons an individual is interested in applying to both the role and the company. There are a wide range of opinions as to how best to write a cover letter. This guide outlines one typical approach.</p>

      <h2 id="layout">Layout</h2>

      <h3 id="general-layout">General Layout</h3>
      <p>In a formal letter the sender's address is right justified whilst the recipient's address is left justified. The date at the time the letter is written is also usually added. The recipient should be addressed by name if known, otherwise an appropriate salutation may include (amongst others) "To whom it may concern" or "Dear Sir or Madam". Following the salutation there should be one line which states clearly the intent of the letter, which in this context is an application for a specific role.</p>

      <p>There are then usually three key sections of a cover letter. The first section covers the background history of the individual. This includes their academic degree(s) as well as any recent work experience and is therefore only a small number of sentences long. The next section describes the reasons for which an individual is making an application to both the role and the company. This will usually be a sizeable paragraph.</p>

      <p>The final section describes in more detail how the skills and experiences of the individual meet the requirements of the role and match the values of the company. This will usually be the largest section of the cover letter and may be two or three paragraphs.</p>

      <p>The cover letter should end with a closing summary, drawing the letter to a close. If the recipient is known by name, "Yours sincerely" should be used, otherwise use "Yours faithfully". In most cases the cover letter should not exceed a single side of A4.</p>

      <p>The layout of a typical cover letter is shown below for a fictious individual named <i>John Doe</i> applying to the fictitious <i>Company XY</i> and addressed to the fictitious recipient <i>Jane Doe</i>:</p>

          ...<br><br>
          Finally, I am flexible to other opportunities that you may have available. I have attached a CV for your consideration to support my application. I thank you for your time and look forward to hearing from you.<br><br>
          Yours sincerely,<br><br>

      <h3 id="format">Format</h3>
      <p>A cover letter should be written in a document writing software such as MS Word or LaTeX. Since assessors may view the document using different software and platforms, it is desirable for the document to be submitted using the .pdf format. If this format is used, make sure that the text is not embedded so that a scanning tool can read the text easily. In practical terms this means that when the document is opened in this format, the text can be highlighted and copied easily. Always check the final document before submitting. This ensures that the formatting has not changed. If changes are needed, make them using the original software that was used to first create the document. Generally the following rules should be followed:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Use typical fonts such as Times New Roman, Liberation Serif or Computer Modern.</li>
        <li>Use black colour only.</li>
        <li>Use bold or italics sparingly.</li>
        <li>Avoid using tables for formatting as this may interfere with the scanning tool.</li>
        <li>Avoid using any graphics.</li>
        <li>Avoid very narrow page margins.</li>
        <li>Avoid using boarders.</li>
        <li>Use paragraphs instead of bullet points.</li>
        <li>Include your surname when choosing the document file name. For the person named John Doe, one example is "JDoeCoverLetter.pdf".</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="language-style">Language style</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use plain simple English, i.e. avoid using obscure words and phrases unless necessary.</li>
        <li>Avoid text speak and American English.</li>
        <li>Abbreviations not universally known should be explained when first used in the cover letter.</li>
        <li>Use numbers to quantify the scope of an achievement, e.g. "presented to 30 people".</li>
        <li>Use the first person narrative.</li>
      </ul>
