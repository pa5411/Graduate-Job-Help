        <h1>Video Assessments</h1>
        <h2> What is a video assessment?</h2>
                
        <p> These are tests where you are given several questions and are required to answer these questions using a video recording At a later date, a human and/or AI (Artificial Intelligence) algorithm will then grade your assessment. </p>

        <p> Video assessments may be completely independent assessments or integrated as part of a wider set of assessment which may additionally include numerical and situational assessments. They may be carried out directly through the company website or through a third party solution such as HireVue. You can typically use a PC, Mac, laptop, tablet or phone to do the recording.</p>

        <h2>General structure of video assessments</h2>

        <h3>Promotional content</h3>

        <p> Some companies have promotional videos both before and during the assessment. These videos usually describe what you can expect during your assessment and may also provide you with general tips and advice. </p>

        <h3>Before the assessment</h3>

        <p> You will often be provided with an opportunity to get used to the technology by answering a practice question before you begin the assessment. Answers to practice questions are usually not checked, but you should confirm this by reading through the instructions carefully during your test. After you are provided with the practice question, you have a certain period of time to prepare a response. In this guide this will be referred to as the "preparation time". After the preparation time has ended, you are required to begin recording your response. In this guide this will be referred to as the "response time". </p>
                
        <p> Usually the practice questions will be of a similar format to the questions that you will face during the assessment. Therefore if the preparation time is 3 minutes and the response time is 1 minute, it is reasonable to expect that the questions during your assessment will also have times of 3 minutes and 1 minute respectively. However, this is not a guarantee, so it is best to read the instructions carefully. </p>
        
        <p> Note that a question may contain multiple parts to it. For example, you may be asked "Why have you applied for the company. In your response, think about the role, your interests and your career ambitions". </p>
                 
        <p> You may be offered the opportunity to answer several different practice questions multiple times or just the same question multiple times. Alternatively, you may only be offered an opportunity to answer a practice question once. Use the practice questions to adjust your webcam, audio and lighting settings accordingly.</p>
        
        <h3>During the assessment</h3>

        <p> The assessment itself may have several questions. The most restrictive preparation time you may face will be 30 seconds whilst the most restrictive response time you may face is 60 seconds. Many companies provide longer times, for example, 3 minutes to prepare and 5 minutes to respond. The majority of companies will only allow you ONE opportunity to record an answer. A small number of companies provide two opportunities or more for you to record an answer. You may be able to take a short break between answering each question. However, it may not be possible to close the assessment and restart it at the same point. It is therefore advised to complete the assessment in one sitting. </p>

         <h3> After the assessment</h3>

         <p> It is unlikely you will receive human feedback from your assessment although you may receive feedback generated by an AI system. You should receive an email informing you whether you have passed or failed. Unfortunately, the emails may not always be clear. For example, if you receive a rejection email, it may mean that you failed the video assessment. Alternatively, it may also mean that you passed the video assessment but your overall application including all tests up until this point did not meet the required threshold. Similarly, whilst an email which states that you have passed may mean that you have passed the video assessment, it does not always guarantee that you will proceed to the next stage of the application process. </p>
                 
        <h2> How to prepare </h2>
       
        <p> Many video assessments ask competency based questions. For specific advice about stength, competency and technical questions, refer to the <a href="/interview.html">interview</a> guide. </p>
        
        <h3> General recording tips </h3>
        
        <ul>
                <li> If there is both a video and situational assessment, use a device with a keyboard to complete written tasks more easily.</li>
                <li> Always wear formal clothes unless explicitly told otherwise. </li>
                <li> Make sure you are in a well-lit room so that the assessor can see your eyes clearly.</li>
                <li> Avoid distracting objects in the background such as posters. Use a clear background such as an empty wall instead. </li>
                <li> Ensure that your recording device is fixed on a flat surface so that it cannot move during the assessment. </li>
                <li> Charge any devices before your starting assessment. </li>
                <li> It may be helpful to practice recording videos on the device that you will use for the assessment before you start. </li>
                <li> Look directly into the webcam when recording your answer. </li>
                <li> If you wear glasses, limit glare from the device display by reducing its brightness setting. Ensure that your glasses are clean. </li>
                <li> Avoid looking into the webcam from unusual angles. Make sure that your entire face is visible and fills a good portion of the frame. </li>
                <li> Avoid talking too quickly or too slowly. Take pauses where necessary. If possible, get feedback from another individual. </li>
        </ul> 
        
        <h3> Tips on the video structure</h3> 

        <ul>
                <li> For questions with multiple parts, if possible, display the question as you are recording your answer. </li>
                <li> Read any correspondance carefully. They may give guidance on the format and questions that you will face. </li>
                <li> Similarly, read the company career website carefully, as it may also contain useful information. </li>
                <li> Check websites or social media such as TheStudentRoom, Glassdoor or /r/UKJobs where other users may share their experiences. </li>      
        </ul>
