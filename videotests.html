        <h1>Video Assessments</h1>
        <h2> What is a video assessment?</h2>
                
        <p> These are tests where you are given several questions and you are required to record using video, your answers to these questions. At a later date, a human  and/or AI (Artificial Learning) algorithm will then grade your assessment. </p>

        <p> Video assessments may be completely independent assessments or integrated as part of a wider assessment which combines several assessments, e.g. video, numerical and situational assessment. They may be carried out directly through the company website or through a third party solution such as HireVue.</p>

        <h2>General structure of video assessments</h2>

        <h3>Promotional content</h3>

        <p> Some companies have promotional videos both before and during the assessment. These videos usually describe what you can expect during your assessment and may also give you general tips and advice. </p>

        <h3>Practice Question(s)</h3>

        <p> You will often be provided with an opportunity to get used to the technology by answering a practice question before you begin the assessment. Answers to practice questions are usually not checked, but you should confirm this by reading through the instructions carefully during your test. After you are provided with the practice question, you have a certain period of time to prepare a response. In this guide I will refer to this as the "preparation time". After the preparation time has ended, you are required to begin recording your response. In this guide I will refer to this as the "response time". </p>
                
         <p> Usually, the practice questions will be of a similar format to the questions that you will face during the assessment. Therefore if the preparation time is 3 minutes and the response time is 1 minute, it is reasonable to expect that the questions during your assessment will also have times of 3 minutes and 1 minute respectively. However, this is not a guarantee, so it is best to read the instructions carefully. </p>
                 
         <p> You may be offered the opportunity to answer several different practice questions multiple times or just the same question multiple times. Alternatively, you may only be offered an opportunity to answer a practice question once. Use the practice questions to adjust your webcam, audio and lighting settings accordingly.</p>
