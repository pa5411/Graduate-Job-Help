      <h1>Video Tests</h1>
      <p>This is an assessment where there is a requirement that all responses to questions are made by recording answers on a video. No assessor is present whilst the responses are recorded and therefore the assessment can be completed at any time before the given deadline. At a later date, a human and/or AI (Artificial Intelligence) algorithm will then grade the assessment.</p>

      <h2 id="general-structure">General Structure</h2>
      
      <p>Video assessments may be set as a single task or integrated with other assessments as part of several tasks to be completed. If there are other tasks they are usually simply psychometric tests. The assessment may be carried out directly through the company website or through a third party solution such as HireVue. Usually the video recordings can be made on any device such as PC, Mac, laptop, tablet or phone. Details on how to set-up the test and any technology are provided via an email from the company.</p>      
      
      <h3 id="promotional-content">Promotional content</h3>
      <p>Some employers include promotional video material both before and during the assessment. These videos may also describe what can be expected during the assessment as well as provide general advice and hints.</p>

      <h3 id="question-structure">Question structure</h3>
      <p>For each question, a period of time is allocated to prepare a response. In this guide this will be referred to as the "preparation time". After the preparation time has ended, there may be a short delay of a few seconds. In this guide this will be referred to as the "delay time". A period of time is then allocated to record the response. In this guide this will be referred to as the "response time".</p>
      
      <dl>
        <dt><i>Preparation time</i>:</dt>
          <dd>Time allocated to think about a response. Typical time periods can be as short as 30 seconds up to an unlimited amount of time.</dd>
        <dt><i>Delay time</i>:</dt>
          <dd>A very short period of time which gives a warning that the recording is about to begin. Usually in the form of an on-screen countdown of about 5 seconds.</dd>
        <dt><i>Response time</i>:</dt>
          <dd>Time allocated to record a response. Typical time periods can be one minute up to about 5 minutes.</dd>
      </dl>
      
      <p>A question may contain multiple parts. For example, you may be asked "Why have you applied for the company. In your response, think about the role, your interests and your career ambitions". A good response will therefore address each part of the question.</p>

      <h3 id="practice-questions">Practice questions</h3>
      <p>An opportunity is usually provided to get used to the technology by answering a practice question before starting the assessed questions. Answers to practice questions are not normally checked, but this should be confirmed by reading through the instructions that have been given.</p>

      <p>Usually the practice questions will be of a similar format to the assessed questions. Therefore if the preparation and response times for the practice questions are 3 minutes and 1 minute respectively, it is reasonable to assume that the assessed questions will also have the same format. However this is not a guarantee, so as stated before, read the given instructions carefully.</p>

      <p>There may be an opportunity to answer several different practice questions multiple times. Alternatively, there may only be an opportunity to answer one practice question multiple times. If a practice question is not provided, then there should be some means to test the recording device before the assessment begins. Use any practice question(s) to adjust any webcam, audio and lighting settings accordingly.</p>

      <h3 id="assessed-questions">Assessed questions</h3>
      <p>There may be several assessed questions. The most restrictive preparation time may be 30 seconds whilst the most restrictive response time may be 60 seconds. Many companies provide longer times, for example, 3 minutes to prepare and 5 minutes to respond. The majority of companies will allow only one opportunity to record an answer however a small number of companies provide two opportunities or more to record a response.</p> 
      
      <p>It should be possible to take a short break between answering each question. However, it may not be possible to close the assessment and restart it at the same point. The instructions should therefore be read carefully about what is and is not allowed.</p>

      <h3 id="feedback">Feedback</h3>
      <p>It is unlikely that human-based feedback will be provided after the assessment is completed although feedback generated by an AI system may be provided. At some point, an email will be sent which outlines whether the assessment has been passed or failed. </p>
      
      <p>Unfortunately the emails are not always clear. For example, if a rejection email is received, it may mean that the video assessment has been failed. Alternatively, it may also mean that the video assessment was passed but the overall application including all tests up until this point did not meet the required threshold. Similarly, an email which states that an applicant has passed the assessment does not always guarantee that they will proceed to the next stage of the application process. This is again because the required threshold which covers the overall application up until this point may not have been met.</p>

      <h2 id="general-tips">General Tips</h2>
      <p>General tips on using video software to interact with employers can be found in the <a href="/uk-graduate-job-advice/generalvideorecordingtips.html">video recording tips guide</a>. Many video assessments ask competency based questions. For specific advice about competency questions as well as strength and technical questions, refer to the <a href="/uk-graduate-job-advice/interview.html">interview guide</a>.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Read any correspondence carefully. It may give guidance on the format and type of questions.</li>
        <li>Similarly, read the company career website carefully, as it may also contain useful information.</li>
        <li>Check websites or social media such as TheStudentRoom, Glassdoor or /r/UKJobs where other users may share their experiences.</li>     
      </ul>

      <h3 id="tips-to-answer-the-questions">Tips to answer the questions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid reading answers from a script. Use prompt cards or notes which are out of frame instead.</li>
        <li>Be prepared to give short but detailed answers. Avoid sharing unnecessary details.</li>
        <li>If you cannot think of an answer, use a hypothetical example instead.</li>
        <li>For multiple part questions, if possible, display the question whilst recording an answer.</li>
        <li>For multiple part questions, respond to each part of the question in the same order as it is given.</li>  
        <li>If you freeze, take a deep breath and either start the response again (if possible) or continue with your original response.</li>
        <li>For competency based questions, use the STAR approach. See the <a href="/uk-graduate-job-advice/interview.html">interview guide</a> for further help.</li>
        <li>For questions about the industry, company and the role, see the <a href="/uk-graduate-job-advice/researchingcompaniesandtopics.html">researching a company guide</a> for further help.</li>
