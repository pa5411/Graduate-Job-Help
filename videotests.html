  <h1>Video Tests</h1>
  <p>This is an assessment where several questions are given and responses are given by recording answers on video. There is no human present whilst the responses are recorded and therefore they can be completed at any time before the given deadline. At a later date, a human and/or AI (Artificial Intelligence) algorithm will then grade the assessment.</p>

  <p>Video assessments may be independent assessments or integrated as part of a wider set of assessments which may additionally include numerical and situational components. They may be carried out directly through the company website or through a third party solution such as HireVue. They can typically be carried out using a PC, Mac, laptop, tablet or phone to do the recording.</p>

  <h2>General structure of video assessments</h2>
  <h3>Promotional content</h3>
  <p>Some employers include promotional video material both before and during the assessment. These videos may also describe what can be expected during the assessment as well as provide general tips and hints.</p>

  <h3>Before the assessment</h3>
  <p>An opportunity is usually provided to get used to the technology by answering a practice question before completing the assessed questions of the assessment. Answers to practice questions are usually not checked, but this should be confirmed by reading through the instructions that have been given. After a practice question is given, a period of time is allocated to prepare a response. In this guide this will be referred to as the "preparation time". After the preparation time has ended, a period of time is allocated to record the response. In this guide this will be referred to as the "response time".</p>

  <p>Usually the practice questions will be of a similar format to the assessed questions. Therefore if the preparation and response times for the practice questions are 3 minutes and 1 minute respectively, it is reasonable to assume that the assessed questions will also have the same format. However this is not a guarantee, so as stated before, read the given instructions carefully.</p>

  <p>Note that a question may contain multiple parts. For example, you may be asked "Why have you applied for the company. In your response, think about the role, your interests and your career ambitions".</p>

  <p>There may be an opportunity to answer several different practice questions multiple times. Alternatively, there may only be an opportunity to answer one practice question multiple times. If a practice question is not provided, then there should be some means to test the recording device before the assessment begins. Use any practice question(s) to adjust any webcam, audio and lighting settings accordingly.</p>

  <h3>During the assessment</h3>
  <p>There may be several assessed questions. The most restrictive preparation time may be 30 seconds whilst the most restrictive response time may be 60 seconds. Many employers provide longer times, for example, 3 minutes to prepare and 5 minutes to respond. The majority of employers will only allow ONE opportunity to record an answer. A small number of employers provide two opportunities or more to record a response. It may be possible to take a short break between answering each question. However, it may not be possible to close the assessment and restart it at the same point. It is therefore advised to complete the assessment in one sitting.</p>

  <h3>After the assessment</h3>
  <p>It is unlikely that human-based feedback will be provided after the assessment is completed although feedback generated by an AI system may be provided. At some point, an email will be sent which outlines whether the assessment has been passed or failed. Unfortunately the emails are not always clear. For example, if a rejection email is received, it may mean that the video assessment has been failed. Alternatively, it may also mean that the video assessment was passed but the overall application including all tests up until this point did not meet the required threshold. Similarly, an email which states that an applicant has passed the assessment does not always guarantee that they will proceed to the next stage of the application process, again because the required threshold may not have been met.</p>

  <h2>How to prepare</h2>
  <p>Many video assessments ask competency based questions. For specific advice about strength, competency and technical questions, refer to the<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/interview.html">interview</a>guide.</p>

  <h3>Tips on the video structure</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>For questions with multiple parts, if possible, display the question whilst recording an answer.</li>
    <li>Read any correspondence carefully. They may give guidance on the format and type of questions.</li>
    <li>Similarly, read the company career website carefully, as it may also contain useful information.</li>
    <li>Check websites or social media such as TheStudentRoom, Glassdoor or /r/UKJobs where other users may share their experiences.</li>     
  </ul>

    <li>Be prepared to give short but detailed answers. Avoid sharing unecessary details.</li>
    <li>If you cannot think of an answer, use a hypothetical example instead.</li>
    <li>For multiple part questions, respond to each part of the question in the same order as it is given.</li>  
    <li>If you freeze, take a deep breath and either start the response again or continue with your original response.</li>
    <li>For competency based questions, use the STAR approach. See<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/interview.html">here</a>for guidance.</li>
