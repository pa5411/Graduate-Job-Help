        <h1> Assessment Centres </h1>
			
		<p> An assessment centre (AC) is a set of activities which include an interview in combination with other activities which may include one or more of the following: role-playing exercises, team based tasks, technical exercises, presentations and psychometric tests. The activities usually last a total of a few hours but may also run for a full working day. These activities may be carried out in-person or "virtually", which means it is carried out using video calling software. In both cases, it is often the first time during the application process that both the applicant and an employee that works for the company will directly interact with each other. </p>
		
		<p> The AC may be thought of as an "extended" interview, whereby applicants are assessed throughout its duration. It should therefore be assumed that the assessment begins from the moment the applicant enters a company building (starts a video call) and only ends when leaving the building (ending the video call). In some cases any interactions with other people, including receptionists, security guards and other applicants may be observed and noted. </p>

        <p> Many companies will use some form of a scoring system to assess each applicant. To pass the AC each applicant will therefore need to exceed a certain score or threshold. Passing the AC does not guarantee progress to the next stage of the application process, since many applicants may exceed the threshold. To obtain a high score an applicant will need to perform well on each activity as well as leave a good impression on the assessors. </p>

		<p> Each activity including the interview is designed to help the assessors gain insight of the applicant's suitability for both the role and the company. This means that for each activity, the applicant needs to demonstrate the skills and values necessary to succeed in the role and at the company to which is being applied. They should both be thoroughly understood before the day of the AC. Throughout the activities, assessors may also consider other skills some of which include general enthusiasm, persona and industry knowledge. </p>

		<p> Aside from the assessments, there may be moments to interact with other applicants or other employees during the AC. Remember that this is a business environment where many new people will be encountered with unknown personalities. It is therefore important to avoid conversation topics which in some circumstances may lead to controversy or distress. This depends on the nature of the job to which is being applied but may include topics such as health or politics. Avoid becoming too relaxed and conversational. Whilst it is good to mingle with others, it can be easy to overshare. A mindset of "less is more" is therefore useful in these situations. </p>	

		<h2> Specific activity advice </h2>
		
		<h3> Interviews </h3>
		
		<p> As stated above, nearly every AC includes an interview. Guidance on how to prepare for the various types of interviews can be found <a href="/interview.html">here</a>. </p>
		
		<h3> Role-playing exercise </h3>
		
		<p> Instructions should be provided on the day regarding how this exercise will be carried out. Some role playing exercises require dealing with a difficult client. In such cases, be wary of issuing an apology to the individual as this can be an omission of guilt. De-escalate the situation by focusing on identifying how the individuals problem can be solved. Other role playing exercises may require dissemination and analysis of data which is then presented as a solution to a problem. In forming a solution, it may be useful to consider budgets, time constraints, risk and strategy. </p>
		
		<p> There are a wide number of roles and exercises which may be carried out. Some examples of roles for applicants may include assuming the position of a junior worker, senior worker or manager. Similarly, an assessor may assume the role of a client or a senior colleague. It is not necessary to physically act differently regardless of what role is assumed. Instead, consider what is being said, i.e. decisions, actions and their consequences. It may be helpful to demonstrate a clear logical line of reasoning and/or demonstrate working with other colleagues, depending on what has been asked. </p>
		
		<h3> Team exercise </h3>
		
		<p> It is useful to take upon roles in the team although not necessary. Some individuals prefer to lead whereas others prefer time keeping, occasionally informing the group of the remaining time that is left. Other roles may include taking minutes. Do not be afraid to challenge other views or ideas, but do so constructively. Do not explicitly tell another team member that they are "wrong". Instead, state how their viewpoint (idea) could be improved. One should also not be afraid to defend their own position within reason. State the reason(s) for taking the position but offer an opportunity and willingness to improve or change that position based on solid reasoning. </p>
		
		<p> Unfortunately there are occasions where an argument may occur. Sometimes the argument may resolve itself. Alternatively, an argument may be resolved by emphasising that the team needs to move on as time is being wasted. If applicable, a vote could be held on which opinion or idea is best. If neither approach works out, then the team may be penalised, with the parties involved in the argument potentially penalised more harshly. It is therefore important to maintain a good working team dynamic as best as possible. Note that some debate is necessary and organic. In this guide, the two extreme ends of debate are referred to as "healthy" debate and a "disruptive" debate. A "healthy" debate is where ideas are shared and opinions evolve. However a "disruptive" debate is where two parties do not come to an agreement and begin to argue endlessly without compromise. It is the latter which should be avoided, although some intuition is needed to identify when a debate becomes disruptive. </p> 
		
		<p> Some other useful tips can be found below: </p>
		
		<ul>
		        <li> Talk to people using their first names. Avoid saying "girl in black dress" etc. </li>
				<li> Do not interrupt someone else who is speaking. </li>
				<li> Take note of what others say. Use what was previously said when speaking later to show the other view has been considered. </li>
				<li> Be sure to speak at least once but do not feel pressured into speaking until necessary. </li>
				<li> Consider budget, stakeholders, short and long-term strategy and risk when developing a solution. </li>	
		</ul>
		
		<h3> Technical exercise </h3>
		
		<p> These are exercises which test applicants on soft or technical skills such as time management and data analysis. They can be thought of as similar to psychometric tests. As with the role-playing exercises there may be a wide range of exercises which can be given. Some of them may include time management exercises or document writing exercises which are described below: </p>
		
		<h4> Time Management Exercises </h4>
		
		<p> These are exercises where a certain number of tasks need to be performed within a short period of time. Some companies use exercises which are not always possible to fully complete, so tasks should be prioritised accordingly. For example, it is likely that tasks from a manager or the CEO will be more important than tasks from a junior colleague. </p>

		<h4> Document Writing Exercises </h4>
		
		<p> Document writing exercises may include tasks such as writing an email, letter or report. Emails addressed to other individuals should start and end with the same introductions that the company uses. This information can often be found in material that has been provided with the exercise. If this information is not available or another document such as a letter is written, then other notation may be used. In those circumstances, it is customary to start with "Hello [X]" if the person is known or "Dear Sir/Madam" if they are not. The document may then be ended with "Yours sincerely" when the person is known or "Yours faithfully" when the individual is not known. Emails are often less formal than letters and reports so may often be started and ended with "Hello [X]" and "Regards" or "Thanks" respectively. </p>
		
		<p> The length of the document depends on what is being asked. The question should therefore be read carefully. Usually emails should be short and concise, whereas letters and reports are longer, but this need not always be the case. Ideally there should be only a handful of sentences per paragraph. Both lengthy sentences and paragraphs should be avoided. This is simpler for an assessor to read and grade than one large sentence or paragraph of text. It is fine to use bullet points to summarise findings in certain parts of the document or to write lists. However, it is usually best to avoid using bullet points to write entire documents unless explicitly told that this is an acceptable approach. </p>
		
		<h3> Presentations </h3>
		
		<p> An applicant may sometimes be asked to deliver a presentation on a given topic. Guidance on how to prepare for this task can be found <a href="/deliveringpresentations.html">here</a>. </p>
		
		<h3> Psychometric Tests </h3>
		
		<p> An applicant may sometimes be asked to repeat tests carried out previously to verify their earlier test scores. In addition or alternatively, there may also be different psychometric tests to complete. Guidance on how to prepare for the various types of psychometric tests can be found <a href="/psychometrictests.html">here</a>. </p>
		
		<h2> General AC advice </h2>
		
		<p> It is important to try to remain calm throughout the AC. Applicants are usually assessed on their overall performance and therefore a good score can still be achieved despite appearing to perform poorly for one part of the AC. </p> 
		
		<p> Ensure that the role and the company have both been researched. Guidance on this can be found <a =href="/researchingcompaniesandtopics.html">here</a>. It is important to get sufficient rest before the AC. It is likely to be better to rest fully and have a few hours more revision in the morning if needed rather than to stay up through the night. </p>
		
		<h3> Virtual AC Advice </h3>
		
		<p> The main difference between a virtual AC and an in-person AC is that the virtual AC is carried out using video recording software. Instructions will be provided in an email regarding the technical software to be used. Technical support may also be provided during the day should issues arise. </p>
		
		<p> It is strongly advised to use a laptop or desktop PC with a keyboard and mouse. This is because the AC may contain tasks which require multitasking as well as typing documents, emails or notes. Such tasks are simpler to carry out using laptops or desktops compared to a phone or tablet. General tips on using video software to interact with employers can be found <a href="/generalvideorecordingtips.html">here</a>. </p>
		
        <h3> Before the AC </h3>
		
		<ul>
		        <li> Have a bottle of water. It is acceptable to drink when necessary. Avoid making "slurping" noises when drinking. </li>
				<li> Have some some food on hand. Only eat during breaks (and off camera if virtual). </li>
				<li> Have a pen, calculator and paper on hand. </li> 
				<li> Inform the company if reasonable adjustments are needed. </li>
				<li> Obtain any documentation requested (e.g. passport, bank statements etc). </li>
		</ul>

        <h3> During the AC </h3>
		
		<p> Aside from completing the activities described above, applicants may also be given tasks where they must assess their own performance for any number of preceding activities. It is important to be honest here but within reason. State a few parts which went well and a few parts which either did not go well or were difficult to accomplish. For those parts which did not go well, state a different approach which could be carried out to make the task either simpler to understand and/or faster to complete. It may also be useful to state what was learned from the task with regards to soft skills and how that knowledge will be used to approach future activities. </p>
		
		<p> Some other general tips are: </p>
		
		<ul>
		        <li> Always wear formal clothes unless explicitly told otherwise. </li>
				<li> Avoid slang and profanity. </li>
				<li> Resist the urge to interrupt anyone that is speaking. </li>
				<li> Avoid chewing gum apart from during a break if necessary. </li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3> After the AC </h3>
		
		<p> Many companies offer some form of feedback once the AC is completed. This may be generalised, giving a broad overview of how well the applicant performed across the different activities carried out during the AC. Alternatively, the feedback may be broken down into parts, with each part covering a particular activity. The AC may form the last part of the application process or there may be another stage after the AC is completed, which may include a technical or an "informal" interview. </p>
		
		<p> Feedback is usually received within a few hours up to a week or two. It may either be automated using AI or typed up by a human. In some cases a HR employee may arrange a call to give feedback. If this is the last stage of the application process, an acceptance or rejection response may also be received within a similar time frame. This may be received either before or after feedback is given. An acceptable offer is usually received via a phone call. If several weeks have passed without hearing a response, it is worth contacting the company via email for an update. </p>
