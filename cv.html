        <h1>CV</h1>
        <p> This is a document where the skills and experiences of a candidate are outlined which demonstrate both how well they fit with the culture of the company and their ability to perform well in the role. Most applications require a CV document to be provided. Note that there are a wide range of opinions as to how best to write a CV. This guide outlines the aproach as suggested by volunteers from TheStudentRoom. </p> 
                
        <h2> Content </h2>
        
        <p> The CV should be written in reverse-chronological order, i.e. with the most recent experiences at the top. They must include the first name and surname of the candidate as well as contact details such as a phone number and an email address. A home address and a link to a website such as a GitHub portfolio may be added where necessary. The remainder of the document must have sections which include relevant work experience and education history. Hobbies or interests can also be mentioned in a dedicated section but they should also be relevant. For each experience or interest, to determine if they are relevant, a list can be written of both soft and technical skills. These skills can then be compared to the values of the company as well as the person specification of the job description. If there is a match, it may be useful to include them.  </p>
        
        <p> Other sections may be added depending on the individual and the nature of the role. This may include a background summary as well as sections for technical skills, publications and references. Refer to the company website as well as the job description for information on what is expected, otherwise use common sense. Non-research roles for example, are unlikely to read through a list of publications. </p>
        
        <h3> Education History </h3>
        
        <p> This section should include details about all the university degrees that have been ontained, up to and including PhD level. All grades should be indicated where applicable. PhD graduates should write either the type of degree that is written on the transcript or the subject. The title of the thesis should usually not be included. A-Level qualifications (or equivalent) should be included. Undergraduates and postgraduate students may wish to mention GCSE results (or equivalent). However PhD graduates should omit them unless requested by the company. Do not include achievements or awards in this section. They should instead go in a separate section. </p>
        
        <h3> Work Experience </h3>
        
        <p> This section should include experience that gained from any degree as well as extra-curricular activities such as sports, part-time work and volunteering. </p>

        <h3> Interests </h3>
        
        <p> Any interests related to the role may be included in this section, but it is important to support any interests with evidence. For example, an interest in programming may be supported by participation in an online course. </p>
        
        <h3> Skills </h3>
        
        <p> This is a short section where any technical or software skills can be outlined. Sometimes the proficiency of each skill can be stated, e.g. Word (Expert) although such terminology can be vague and misleading. It is therefore always best practice to demonstrate how each technical skill was used in examples given in the work experience section. The skills section should be viewed as a short summary for an assessor to quickly determine the key technical skills of a candidate. Depending on the nature of the role, this section can often be omitted. However, for IT or computing roles, this section is useful to highlight efficiently core skills. Avoid putting generic soft skills such as "team player" or "leader". You may wish to put some licenses and certifications in this section or in their own separate section. Examples of useful skills to include are: </p>
       
        <ul>
                <li> Programming languages such as Python or Java. </li>
                <li> Major (relevant) libraries such as Tensorflow. </li>
                <li> Software tools such as MS Word, MS Excel and Adobe Illustrator. </li>
