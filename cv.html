        <h1>CV</h1>
        <p> This is a document where the skills and experiences of the applicant are outlined. The document should demonstrate how well the applicant fits with the culture of the company and their ability to perform well in the role. Most applications require a CV document to be provided. A CV may be read by a human or scanned using software for key words or phrases. Note that there are a wide range of opinions as to how best to write a CV. This guide outlines just one approach. </p> 
                
        <h2> Content and Format Summary</h2>
        
        <h3> Content summary </h3>
        
        <p> The CV should be written in reverse-chronological order, i.e. with the most recent experiences at the top. They must include the first name and surname of the applicant as well as contact details such as a phone number and an email address. A link to a website such as a GitHub portfolio may be added where necessary. Avoid putting a date of birth, home address and any details about race, sexuality or religion. If putting a CV on an agency board or public domain, consider using secondary contact information, such as a second email address and phone number to avoid spam. </p> 
		
		<p> The remainder of the document must have a section which includes dated relevant examples from work experience as well as a dated outline of the applicant's education history. For each example, to determine if they are relevant, a list can be written of both soft and technical skills. These skills can then be compared to the values of the company as well as the person specification of the job description. If there is a match, it may be useful to include them. Sometimes a skill which is not directly listed may still be useful to include. Hobbies or interests can also be mentioned in a dedicated section provided that they are relevant. It is important to stress that if an example is not relevant, then it should not be included in the CV unless there is remaining space to fill. An element of judgement is often needed to determine what items to keep and those to omit. </p>
        
        <p> Other sections may be added depending on the individual and the nature of the role. This may include a background summary as well as sections for technical skills, publications and references. Refer to the company website as well as the job description for information on what is expected, otherwise use common sense. Human Resource staff from companies advertising non-research roles for example, are unlikely to read through a list of publications. </p>
        
        <h3> Format summary </h3>
        
        <p> A CV can be written in any notes or documents software such as Notepad, MS Word or LaTeX. However, since assessors may view the document using different software and platforms, it may be desirable for the document to instead be submitted using the .pdf format. If this format is used, make sure that the text is not embedded so that a scanning tool can read the text easily. In other words, when the document is opened in this format, ensure that the text can be copied and pasted easily and does not appear to behave as an image. Always check the final document before submitting, to ensure that the formatting has not changed. If changes are needed, make them using the original software package that was used to first create the document. Generally the following rules should be followed: </p>
        
        <ul>
				<li> Always place the name and contact details at the top of the CV. </li>
				<li> Use a large font size for the name such as 16 and a regular font size such as 11 for the remainder of the text. </li>  
				<li> Use typical fonts such as Times New Roman, Liberation Serif or Computer Modern. </li> 
				<li> Use black colour only. </li>
                <li> Only names, headings and titles should be in bold. </li>
                <li> Avoid using tables for formatting as this may interfere with the scanning tool. </li>
                <li> Avoid any graphics including passport photos. Use a portfolio hosted on a website instead if necessary. </li>
                <li> Avoid paragraphs and use bullet points instead, except for the background summary. </li>
                <li> Ideally use one page but no greater than two pages, with the exception of applications to academic positions. </li>
				<li> Avoid very narrow page margins. </li>
				<li> If there are gaps in the CV, then only use the year part of the date otherwise put both the year and the month. </li>
				<li> Save the CV document as "YourNameCV". </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Content Style </h3>
        
		<ul>
		        <li> Use plain simple English. Avoid text speak and American English. </li>
                <li> Avoid most abbreviations unless they are universally known, e.g. MS Word. </li>
				<li> Avoid using pronouns such as "I", "you", "we", "he" or "she" etc. </li>
				<li> It is useful to start each bullet point with an action verb, such as "presented" or "created". </li>
				<li> Use adverbs such as "carefully" and "accurately" sparingly throughout the CV. </li>
				<li> Use numbers to quantify the scope of an achievement, e.g. "presented to 30 people". </li>
				<li> Keep bullet points to one line if possible and two lines at most. </li>
				<li> Try to ensure that the end of each bullet point extends beyond the half-way point of the page. </li>
		</ul>
        
        <h2> What to write? </h2>
		
		<h3> Background summary </h3>
		
		<p> This is usually a short paragraph which includes a description of all degrees obtained or in progress as well as their key modules or research elements. The summary may highlight main industry related interests backed up with evidence and indicate career goals. In total, the summary should not exceed more than a few sentences. This section is usually not necessary and its inclusion is optional, however if included, it should always be the first section of the CV after the name and contact details. </p>
        
        <h3> Education History </h3>
        
        <p> This section should include details about all the university degrees that have been obtained or are in progress, up to and including PhD level. All grades should be indicated where applicable. PhD graduates should write either the type of degree that is written on the transcript or the subject. The title of the thesis should usually not be included. A-Level qualifications (or equivalent) should be included along with their grades. Undergraduate and postgraduate students may wish to mention the number of GCSE's (or equivalent) and any relevant grades such as English and Maths. However PhD graduates may omit them unless requested otherwise by the company. Place this section either before the work experience section or after it. Do not include achievements or awards in this section. They should go in a separate section instead. </p>
        
        <h3> Relevant Work Experience </h3>
        
        <p> This section should include experience gained from any degree as well as extra-curricular activities such as sports, part-time work, internships, apprenticeships and volunteering. It is the most important section of the CV and therefore should have the most time dedicated to writing it. Each example of an experience should have a list of bullet points which highlight skills that are relevant to the role. It is usual to have between 2 to 4 bullet points for each example. Avoid a situation where one example has a significant number of bullet points compared to the other examples. The intention is to instead highlight a range of skills obtained from a variety of examples. Some ideas for demonstrating common skills are indicated below. </p>
        
        <h4> Examples of communication skills </h4>
        
        <ul>
                <li> Presentations given to an audience during university or conferences. </li>
                <li> Reports or leaflets created for an audience or individual. </li>
                <li> Sketches, diagrams or schematics created for an audience or individual. </li>
                <li> Arranging and attending team meetings. </li>
                <li> Customer-facing work experience such as retail, phone operator, crowd marshal etc. </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4> Examples of attention to detail skills </h4>
        
        <ul>
                <li> Spotting and reporting a bug in programming software or a book. </li>
                <li> Working with complex machinery or equipment. </li>
                <li> Dedicating a period of time to complete a complex task. </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4> Examples of management skills </h4>
        
        <ul>
                <li> Leading a group of people in a team project, sports team or work environment. </li>
                <li> Creating tools such as Gantt charts to work more efficiently. </li>
                <li> Taking responsibility for a project or a problematic situation. </li>
				<li> Being a carer for an individual. </li>
        </ul>     

        <h4> Examples of learning skills/ innovation </h4>
        
        <ul>
                <li> Completion of in-person or online courses. </li>
                <li> Improving an existing idea or product with quantifiable results. </li>
                <li> Developing a new idea or product. </li> 
				<li> Learning and applying new skills for a project or work experience. </li>
        </ul>     		
        
		<p> For jobs with a company, the title used in the CV should be the same title as outlined in the work contract. If there are several positions within the same company, e.g. (Junior, Senior, Manager), then each position should be listed separately. Individuals with little work or volunteering experience will need to be creative in demonstrating their experiences from university instead. For example, in <a href="#figureexampleofcv">Fig. 1</a>, a PhD student has listed two projects separately, labelled project 1 and project 2. Be creative but clear with project names. Useful names include "Team Project on Subject Y" and "Lab Experiment on Subject Z". In both cases, the full name of the company or university as well as its location should be provided. Names which already include the location, such as "Imperial College London", may omit the location. Check that the dates during which any university experiences were completed fit within the date outlined in the education section of the CV. </p> 
		
        <h3> Interests / Hobbies </h3>
        
        <p> Any interests related to the role may be included in this section, but it is important to support them with evidence. For example, an interest in programming may be supported by participation in an online course. Other examples of evidence include hobby projects with portfolios, membership of societies or events attended such as career events or lecture talks. </p>
        
        <h3> Skills </h3>
        
        <p> This is a short section where any technical (or software skills) can be outlined. It is usually placed either immediately after the background summary or immediately after the work experience section. Sometimes the proficiency of each skill is stated, e.g. MS Word (Expert) although such terminology can be vague and misleading. It is therefore always best practice to demonstrate how each technical skill was used in examples given in the work experience section. This is indicated in <a href="#figureexampleofcv">Fig. 1</a>. The skills section should be viewed as a short summary for an assessor to quickly determine the key technical skills of an applicant. Depending on the nature of the role, this section can often be omitted. However, for IT or programming roles, this section is useful to highlight efficiently core skills. Avoid putting any generic soft skills such as "team player" or "leader". You may wish to put some licenses and certifications in this section or in their own separate section. For research roles, experiment or field techniques may be placed here or in their own separate section. Examples of useful skills to include are: </p>
       
        <ul>
                <li> Programming languages such as Python or Java. </li>
                <li> Major (relevant) libraries such as Tensorflow. </li>
                <li> Software tools such as MS Word, MS Excel and Adobe Illustrator. </li>
                <li> Experimental/ Simulation techniques such as Solidworks or FEA. </li>
                <li> Licenses and certifications (*). </li>
        </ul>  
        
		<h3> References </h3>
		
		<p> Before using an individual as a reference, ask them directly and confirm that they are happy to provide a reference upon request. Do not make an assumption that this will be the case. When adding a reference section to the CV, for each individual, add their title, first name, surname and contact details. The name, email address as well as each part of their work address should be on one separate line for clarity. Avoid using the personal home address of a reference. Many companies do not ask for references and therefore this section is often not needed. However, when necessary, two or three references is usually sufficient. The references section should be the last section of the CV. </p>
