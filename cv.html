        <h1>CV</h1>
        <p> This is a document where the skills and experiences of a candidate are outlined. The document should demonstrate how well the candidate fits with the culture of the company and their ability to perform well in the role. Most applications require a CV document to be provided. A CV may be read by a human or scanned using software for key words or phrases. Note that there are a wide range of opinions as to how best to write a CV. This guide outlines the aproach as suggested by volunteers from TheStudentRoom. </p> 
                
        <h2> Content and Format Summary</h2>
        
        <h3> Content summary </h3>
        
        <p> The CV should be written in reverse-chronological order, i.e. with the most recent experiences at the top. They must include the first name and surname of the candidate as well as contact details such as a phone number and an email address. A home address and a link to a website such as a GitHub portfolio may be added where necessary. The remainder of the document must have a section which includes relevant examples from work experience as well as an outline of the candidate's education history. For each example, to determine if they are relevant, a list can be written of both soft and technical skills. These skills can then be compared to the values of the company as well as the person specification of the job description. If there is a match, it may be useful to include them. Hobbies or interests can also be mentioned in a dedicated section provided that they are relevant.  </p>
        
        <p> Other sections may be added depending on the individual and the nature of the role. This may include a background summary as well as sections for technical skills, publications and references. Refer to the company website as well as the job description for information on what is expected, otherwise use common sense. Non-research roles for example, are unlikely to read through a list of publications. </p>
        
        <h3> Format summary </h3>
        
        <p> A CV can be written in any notes or documents software such as Notepad, MS Word or LaTeX. However, since assessors may view the document using different software and platforms, it may be desirable for the document to instead be submitted using the .pdf format. If this format is used, make sure that the text is not embedded so that a scanning tool can read the text easily. In other words, when the document is opened in this format, ensure that the text can be copied and pasted easily and does not appear to behave as an image. Always check the final document before submitting, to ensure that the formatting has not changed. If changes are needed, make them using the original software package that was used to first create the document. Generally the following rules should be followed: </p>
        
        <ul>
                <li> Use black colour only. </li>
                <li> Only headings and titles should be in bold. </li>
                <li> Avoid using tables as this may intefere with the scanning tool. </li>
                <li> Avoid any graphics including photos. Use a portfolio hosted on a website instead if necessary. </li>
                <li> Avoid paragraphs and use bullet points instead, except for the background summary. </li>
                <li> Use plain simple english. Avoid text speak. </li>
                <li> Avoid most abbreviations unless they are universally known, e.g. MS Word. </li>
                <li> All CV's should ideally be one page and no greater than two pages, with the exception of applications to academic positions. </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p> An example of a typical CV with a fake details and information is shown in the image below. Some simple templates are also provided to download for free and modify accordingly. These are located at the bottom of the article for different formats. </p>

        <h3> Content Style </h3>
        
        
        
        <h2> What to write </h2>
        
        <h3> Education History </h3>
        
        <p> This section should include details about all the university degrees that have been ontained, up to and including PhD level. All grades should be indicated where applicable. PhD graduates should write either the type of degree that is written on the transcript or the subject. The title of the thesis should usually not be included. A-Level qualifications (or equivalent) should be included. Undergraduates and postgraduate students may wish to mention GCSE results (or equivalent). However PhD graduates should omit them unless requested by the company. Do not include achievements or awards in this section. They should instead go in a separate section. </p>
        
        <h3> Work Experience </h3>
        
        <p> This section should include experience gained from any degree as well as extra-curricular activities such as sports, part-time work and volunteering. It is the most important section of the CV and therefore should have the most time dedicated to writing it. Each example of an experience should have a list of bullet points which highlight skills that are relevant to the role. It is usual to have between 2 to 4 bullet points for each example. Avoid a situation where one example has a significant number of bullet points compared to the other examples. The intention is to instead highlight a range of skills obtained from variety of examples. </p>
        
        <h4> Examples of communication skills </h4>
        
        <ul>
                <li> Presentations given to an audience during university or conferences. </li>
                <li> Reports or leaflets created for an audience or individual. </li>
                <li> Sketches, diagrams or schematics created for an audience or individual. </li>
                <li> Arranging and attending team meetings. </li>
                <li> Customer-facing work experience such as retail, phone operator, crowd marshall etc. </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4> Examples of attention to detail skills </h4>
        
        <ul>
                <li> Spotting and reporting a bug in programming software or a book. </li>
                <li> Working with complex machinery or equipment. </li>
                <li> Dedicating a period of time to complete a complex task. </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4> Examples of management skills </h4>
        
        <ul>
                <li> Leading a group of people in a team project, sports team or work environment. </li>
                <li> Creating tools such as Gantt charts to work more efficienctly. </li>
                <li> Taking responsibility for a project or a problematic situation. </li>
        </ul>        
        
        <h3> Interests </h3>
        
        <p> Any interests related to the role may be included in this section, but it is important to support them with evidence. For example, an interest in programming may be supported by participation in an online course. Other examples of evidence include hobby projects with portfolios, membership of societies or events attended such as career events or lecture talks. </p>
        
        <h3> Skills </h3>
        
        <p> This is a short section where any technical or software skills can be outlined. Sometimes the proficiency of each skill can be stated, e.g. MS Word (Expert) although such terminology can be vague and misleading. It is therefore always best practice to demonstrate how each technical skill was used in examples given in the work experience section. The skills section should be viewed as a short summary for an assessor to quickly determine the key technical skills of a candidate. Depending on the nature of the role, this section can often be omitted. However, for IT or computing roles, this section is useful to highlight efficiently core skills. Avoid putting any generic soft skills such as "team player" or "leader". You may wish to put some licenses and certifications in this section or in their own separate section. Examples of useful skills to include are: </p>
       
        <ul>
                <li> Programming languages such as Python or Java. </li>
                <li> Major (relevant) libraries such as Tensorflow. </li>
                <li> Software tools such as MS Word, MS Excel and Adobe Illustrator. </li>
                <li> Experimental/ Simulation techniques such as Solidworks or FEA. </li>
                <li> Licenses and certifications (*). </li>
        </ul>
