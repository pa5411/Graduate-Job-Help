        <h1>CV</h1>
        <p> This is a document where you outline your skills and experiences which demonstrate both how well you fit with the culture of the company and your ability to perform well in the role. Most applications require writing a CV document. Note that there are a wide range of opinions as to how best to write a CV. This guide outlines the aproach as suggested by volunteers from TheStudentRoom. </p> 
                
        <h2> Content </h2>
        
        <p> The CV should be written in reverse-chronological order, i.e. with your most recent experiences at the top. They must include your first name and surname as well as contact details such as a phone number and an email address. A home address and a link to a website such as a GitHub portfolio may be added where necessary. The remainder of the document must have sections which include relevant work experience and education history. Hobbies or interests can also be mentioned in a dedicated section but they should also be relevant. For each experience or interest, to determine if they are relevant, a list can be written of both soft and technical skills. These skills can then be compared to the values of the company as well as the person specification. If there is a match, it may be useful to include them.  </p>
        
        <p> Other sections may be added depending on the individual and the nature of the role. This may include a background summary as well as sections for technical skills, publications and references. Refer to the company website as well as the job description for information on what is expected, otherwise use common sense. Non-academic roles for example, are unlikely to read through your list of publications. </p>
        
        <h3> Education History </h3>
        
        <p> This section should include details about all the university degrees that you have, up to and including PhD level. All grades should be indicated where applicable. PhD graduates should write either the type of degree that is written on the transcript or the subject. The title of the thesis should usually not be included. A-Level qualifications (or equivalent) should be included. Undergraduates and postgraduate students may wish to mention GCSE results (or equivalent). However PhD graduates should omit them unless requested by the company. Do not include achievements or awards in this section. They should instead go in a separate section. </p>
        
        <h3> Work Experience </h3>
        
        <p> This section should include experience that you have gained from any degree as well as extra-curricular activities, part-time work or volunteering. </p>
